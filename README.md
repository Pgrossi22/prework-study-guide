# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This webpage was designed utilizing Javascript, CSS, and HTML in order to create a centralized location for class materials. This will allow students to compile study information and content to a public page for further use. Through this project, I learned how to utilize different coding applications to create a visually pleasing, dynamic web page.

## Usage

This application contains different sections of notes dedicated to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This can be utilized to brush up on different pre-work requirements as well as continually incorporating newly learned materials. A good place to start is by opening Chrome DevTools. Here, there are a list of pre-work topics as well as additional study materials.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
